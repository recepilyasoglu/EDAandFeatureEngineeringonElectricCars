## EDA & Feature Engineering on Electric Cars Dataset

### About The Dataset
This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).

### Problem
As the world becomes increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of transportation, electric cars have emerged as a potential solution to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability. However, the adoption of electric cars is still limited due to various factors, including high prices, limited range, and lack of charging infrastructure. To promote the widespread adoption of electric cars, it is essential to understand the current state of the electric car market and identify potential areas for improvement.

### Solution
In this study, it is aimed to analyze and visualize the categorical and numerical variables in the data set, regulations on the variables, analysis of missing values ​​and solutions, creation and analysis of new variables.
